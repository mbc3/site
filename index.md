I write, perform, and direct at the Upright Citzens' Brigade Theater in Los Angeles, and formerly New York. Here's my UCB comedy profile if that matters to you: [http://www.ucbcomedy.com/user/7029](http://www.ucbcomedy.com/user/7029)

I have written for SNL's Weekend Update, The Onion News Network, and the shows Epic How To, Honest Trailers, Honest Game Trailers, Blissful Thinking, and others.

My writing has appeared in McSweeney's, The Onion, College Humor, Splitsider, Trop Magazine, and others.

I'm currently a co-creator and writer for [Functionally Dead](https://www.functionallydead.com), a leftist comedy zine.

I wrote a short story collection called [Nein Stories](/neinstories.md) that I released for free.

I co-created and ran a humor magazine called [Janice](https://www.janicemag.com), which put out two print issues and regularly updated with online content for years. It is now defunct.

You can listen to my finished serialized fiction comedy podcast, ScaryTown, on [Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/scarytown/id1295260047?mt=2) or the [Campfire Media podcast network.](http://wearecampfire.media/podcasts/scarytown/)

I used to have a comedy podcast called Lifescrapers: Tall Stories of American Lives. [You can listen to the archives.](/media/lifescrapers)
